there are four different kinds of macromolecules meaning very large molecules that make up the bulk of cells these are carbohydrates or polysaccharides nucleic acids meaning DNA and RNA lipids including fat and proteins if we look at what kinds of molecules are in cells and let's start off with e-coli here on the left here is what we see is that the bulk of what's in a cell and e.coli is typical is water but if we take out the water and look at everything else in a Cell besides water and here we've expanded that and this is what we call the dry mass and sometimes that dry mass is also equivalent to the biomass and actually the biomass would be all of these organic molecules in a cell and that excludes this few percentage of inorganic molecules this is inorganic molecules right here at the top but all the rest are organic molecules so if you look at the biomass what we see in an e.coli cells is that protein is the most abundant biomass macro molecule and here that's shown in orange the next the most abundant in e.coli or the nucleic acids RNA here shown in yellow and DNA and this light green and then here are in the light blue are the lipids and in the dark green are the polysaccharides this portion here are other small organic molecules which are not macromolecules all of these here then are what we call the macromolecules the large molecules in a Cell so let's compare Ecoline to humans the biomass in humans humans have a comparable amount of protein but much less DNN RNA a lot more lipids and that's because of the fat in our cells and this is fairly typical not just they're human but of most mammalian cells and then finally in this last column we see plant cells plant cells have very little fat very little lipids they have a fair amount of protein but the vast bulk of a plant cell consists of polysaccharides and this is makes a lot of sense because this is going to be cellulose think about all the wood and it's going to be starch think potatoes when we look at macromolecules in thinking about macromolecules I want you to keep three questions in mind these three questions are for each type of macromolecule what are the building blocks so what are the building blocks for each type of macromolecule again for each type of macromolecules what bonds or what what's the glue that holds that building blocks together to make the macro molecule and finally I want you to consider the structure and function of the macromolecules the macromolecules are put together by stringing together monomers or building blocks and think about what will happen with the monomers or the building blocks change each type of structure requires a different set of building blocks and the set of building blocks are actually genetically coded in the DNA so the genetic code specifies the building blocks that are used to make our macromolecules and think in terms of evolutionary terms so if the genetic code specifies the building blocks that then make our mountain macromolecules we said that for evolution to take place we have to have genetic variation and that genetic variation has to make a difference in the ability of the individual organism to survive and reproduce so how does the genetic code do that by altering building blocks by making changes in the building blocks it's going to make changes in the final type of structure that it's going to that's going to result so by changing a building block you're going to change the structure and function of a macro molecule and that is going to affect the ability of the cell or the organism to survive and reproduce in the environment so this is the big question how do changes in the building blocks affect the structure and function of macromolecules
